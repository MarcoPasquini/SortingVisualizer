# SortingVisualizer

This project aims to provide visual representations of several sorting algorithms, including MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort, SelectionSort, and BubbleSort.
The focus is on illustrating the mechanism of each algorithm rather than their time complexity.
Each algorithm is implemented as an in-place sorting method, capturing and displaying every swap operation in a graphical format.
